# Professional

This was meant to be a pseudo portfolio where I was going to host my CV but I decided to just upload commands and one-liners to document my early beginnings in Linux and scripting in general.

Dropping a test code below just to check formatting.

```bash
ls -lrth /home/lab/lab.txt | grep words
```


Thanks!
